# Open-Smartwatch 3D Files

How to read the folder names:

- first part:
  - light edition
  - light edition with round lipo
  - gps edition
- second part:
  - 0.8mm pcb
  - 1.6mm pcb
- third part:
  - 20mm pin wrist straps
  - 3d printed wrist straps

The case requires 10mm M2 hex screws. The printed straps require 6mm M2 hex screws.


## Sleek-Case 3D Files
Sleeker design made to be as compact and "watch like" as possible

Fits with 1.6mm light pcb and round battery
The battery and pcb need to be spaced using a round plastic piece cut from your usual transparent electronics packaging, should be around 0.3mm thick and same diameter as the pcb with a small cutout or flat spot for the battery wires.
The case requires 4 6mm M1.4 hex screws.

There will most likely be some sanding of the button's back face required for them to fit snugly and also not keep the button depressed. 30 seconds on 600 grit sandpaper should work
